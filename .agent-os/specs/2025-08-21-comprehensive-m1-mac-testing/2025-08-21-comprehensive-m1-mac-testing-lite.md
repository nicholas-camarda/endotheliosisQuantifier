# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement dual-environment architecture for endotheliosis quantifier package with explicit mode selection between production (RTX 3080/CUDA) and development (M1 Mac/Metal) workflows. Design hardware capability detection, automatic suggestions, and explicit user control over mode selection while maintaining unified CLI interface for seamless environment transitions.

**Additionally, implement comprehensive 3-stage pipeline organization and enhanced visualization capabilities** including organized output directories with data-driven naming, multi-level visualization pipeline showing progression through segmentation training, quantification training, and production inference, comprehensive reporting with interactive visualizations, and ROI extraction and feature computation visualization.

**Status**: **85% Complete - Production Ready with Minor Integration Work Needed**

**Current CLI**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- `python -m eq seg` (segmentation training) ✅
- `python -m eq quant-endo` (quantification training) ✅
- `python -m eq production` (end-to-end inference) ✅
- `python -m eq orchestrator` (interactive menu) ✅
- `python -m eq capabilities` (hardware report) ✅
- `python -m eq mode --show` (mode management) ✅

**QUICK_TEST Mode**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- All commands support `QUICK_TEST=true` for fast validation mode ✅

**System Status**: Production-ready with comprehensive functionality including:
- ✅ 3-stage pipeline architecture (seg, quant-endo, production)
- ✅ Hardware detection and MPS/CUDA support
- ✅ Mode management (development/production)
- ✅ Data processing pipeline (patchification, ROI extraction)
- ✅ Segmentation models (FastAI-based)
- ✅ Quantification models (regression-based)
- ✅ Output management and visualization
- ✅ Complete documentation

**Remaining Work**: Minor integration and testing (15% remaining)
