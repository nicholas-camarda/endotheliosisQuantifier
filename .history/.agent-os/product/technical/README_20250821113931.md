# Technical Summary

## Pipeline Overview
- Data prep/cache: parse annotations, generate masks, split train/val/test, cache arrays.
- Segmentation: U-Net fine-tuning to detect glomeruli.
- ROI extraction: contour-based ROI extraction from masked images; save to disk.
- Feature extraction: ResNet50 (imagenet) features per ROI.
- Quantification: Random Forest regression to estimate endotheliosis score with CI output.

## Notable Paths (to be centralized)
- Data root: `data/preeclampsia_data` (train/test/cache subdirs)
- Outputs: `output/` (models, predictions)

## Next Steps (engineering)
- Move constants/paths into a shared config module under `src/eq`.
- Expose CLIs for each step; ensure deterministic I/O and logs.
- Consolidate duplicate scripts; ensure one implementation per step.
- Consolidate `scripts/utils/` to a minimal, well-documented set of helpers; remove or merge redundant utilities.
- Exclude large/ephemeral folders from tracking: `notebooks/`, `earlier_models/`.
- Add sample data and smoke tests runnable on M1 and in WSL2.
