# Agent OS Analysis Summary

## Main Idea (inferred)
- Histology image segmentation to extract glomeruli; feature extraction and regression to quantify endotheliosis.

## Key Features (implemented)
- 4-step pipeline in `scripts/main`: load data, train segmenter, run feature extractor, quantify.
- Utilities for preprocessing, patchify, validation, and experiments.
- Notebooks for segmentation experiments and ROI extraction.

## Tech Stack (detected)
- Python 3.9; TensorFlow/Keras (ResNet50), OpenCV, NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn, LightGBM, XGBoost, Matplotlib, TensorFlow Hub.

## Next Steps (aligned to product direction)
- Rename repo to `endotheliosis_quantifier` and standardize Conda env as `eq`.
- Adopt `src/eq` package layout with CLI entrypoints for the 4 steps.
- Centralize configuration of data, cache, and model paths; remove hard-coded paths.
- Consolidate legacy/duplicate scripts and keep a single ROI extractor, feature extractor, and quantifier implementation.
- Decide on training/inference stack (FastAI vs Keras) with M1 + Windows/WSL2 GPU constraints; keep training path intact but optimize for simple inference.
- Add a tiny sample dataset and smoke tests to validate each step cross-platform.
