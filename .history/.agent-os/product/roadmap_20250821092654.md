# Roadmap

## Phase 0: Already Completed
- [x] End-to-end scripts for data prep → segmentation → feature extraction → quantification
- [x] Dataset and feature caching pipeline
- [x] Baseline quantification via Random Forest with validation outputs

## Phase 1: Current Development
- [ ] Rename repository to `endotheliosis_quantifier`; standardize Conda env as `eq`
- [ ] Adopt `src/eq` package layout; add CLI entrypoints (`eq-segment`, `eq-extract`, `eq-quantify`)
- [ ] Centralize configuration (data paths, cache, model paths) in a config module
- [ ] Consolidate scripts: keep a single ROI extractor, feature extractor, and quantifier
- [ ] Decide on FastAI (PyTorch/MPS/CUDA) vs TensorFlow/Keras for training/inference
- [ ] Add a small sample dataset and smoke tests for each pipeline step

## Phase 2: Near-term Enhancements
- [ ] Reproducible segmentation training (configs, metrics, checkpoints)
- [ ] Package release prep (README, examples, versioning)
- [ ] Batch inference CLI for researcher datasets

## Phase 3: Longer-term
- [ ] Optional WSL2 + CUDA (RTX 3080) training flow documented and tested
- [ ] Publish model checkpoints and versioned artifacts
- [ ] Optional demo notebooks with minimal setup
