# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement dual-environment architecture for endotheliosis quantifier package with explicit mode selection between production (RTX 3080/CUDA) and development (M1 Mac/Metal) workflows. Design hardware capability detection, automatic suggestions, and explicit user control over mode selection while maintaining unified CLI interface for seamless environment transitions.

**Additionally, implement comprehensive pipeline organization and enhanced visualization capabilities** including organized output directories with data-driven naming, multi-level visualization pipeline showing progression from raw medical images through final endotheliosis quantification, comprehensive reporting with interactive visualizations, and ROI extraction and feature computation visualization.

**Status**: Pipeline organization completed. Next: Output directory system and enhanced visualization pipeline implementation.
