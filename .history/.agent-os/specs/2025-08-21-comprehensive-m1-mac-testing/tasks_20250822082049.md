## Implementation Notes

### Technical Dependencies
- Task 1 must be completed before Task 2 (environment setup)
- Task 2 must be completed before Task 3 (module availability)
- Task 3 must be completed before Task 4 (architecture foundation)
- Task 4 can be developed in parallel with Task 5 (CLI and migration)
- Task 6 (Pipeline Organization) is completed and provides foundation for Tasks 7-12
- Task 7 (Pipeline Reorganization) is completed and consolidates CLI functionality
- Task 8 (Output Directory System) is completed and provides organized output structure
- Task 9 (Pipeline Simplification) is completed and provides clean, integrated pipeline
- Tasks 10-12 can be developed in parallel after Task 9 completion

### Testing Strategy
- Each major task follows TDD approach with tests written first
- Verification steps ensure existing functionality is evaluated before implementation
- Hardware detection tests will use mocking for cross-platform validation
- Mode selection tests will validate both development and production paths
- Integration tests will verify end-to-end pipeline functionality
- Output directory tests will validate naming conventions and structure
