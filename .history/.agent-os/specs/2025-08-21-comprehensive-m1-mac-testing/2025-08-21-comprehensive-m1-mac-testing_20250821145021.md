# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Dual-Environment Architecture with Explicit Mode Selection
> Created: 2025-08-21
> Status: Planning
> Updated: 2025-08-21 - Confirmed fastai/PyTorch approach based on existing working implementations

## Overview

Implement a sophisticated dual-environment architecture for the endotheliosis quantifier package that enables explicit switching between production (RTX 3080/CUDA) and development (M1 Mac/Metal) workflows using fastai/PyTorch. Design the system to detect hardware capabilities, suggest appropriate modes, and provide explicit user control over workflow selection while maintaining identical CLI interfaces for seamless environment transitions. This approach leverages existing working fastai implementations from the notebooks folder.

## User Stories

### Explicit Mode Selection

As a developer, I want to explicitly choose between production and development modes based on my hardware capabilities and current needs, so that I can have full control over my workflow regardless of whether I'm using a basic M1 Mac or a powerful M3 Max.

**Detailed Workflow:**
- Explicit mode selection via CLI flags (--mode=development/production)
- Hardware capability detection and reporting
- Automatic suggestions for appropriate mode based on detected capabilities
- Ability to override automatic suggestions when needed
- Clear indication of current mode and hardware capabilities

### Flexible Hardware Support

As a user with a powerful Mac (M2 Max, M3 Max, M1 Ultra), I want to be able to run production workloads on my Mac when appropriate, so that I can leverage my hardware capabilities without being forced into development mode.

**Detailed Workflow:**
- Hardware capability assessment and reporting
- Explicit production mode option for powerful Macs
- Automatic suggestions based on actual hardware capabilities
- Performance scaling based on detected hardware
- Clear documentation of hardware requirements for each mode

### Unified Development Experience

As a developer, I want a unified development experience across different hardware configurations, so that I can use the same commands and workflows regardless of my current hardware setup.

**Detailed Workflow:**
- Same CLI interface and commands across all hardware configurations
- Consistent configuration management with hardware-specific optimizations
- Unified error handling and logging
- Identical development and testing procedures
- Seamless code deployment between different environments

## Spec Scope

1. **Explicit Mode Selection** - CLI-based mode selection with development and production options
2. **Hardware Capability Detection** - Comprehensive hardware assessment and capability reporting
3. **Automatic Suggestion System** - Suggest appropriate mode based on detected capabilities
4. **Backend Abstraction Layer** - Automatic selection between Metal (MPS) and CUDA backends using fastai/PyTorch based on mode
5. **Configuration Management** - Mode-specific configuration with hardware-aware settings
6. **Data Scaling Logic** - Automatic data scaling based on selected mode and hardware capabilities
7. **Unified CLI Interface** - Identical command-line interface with mode selection options
8. **Capability Reporting** - Clear reporting of hardware capabilities and current mode

## Out of Scope

- Cross-platform compatibility beyond Mac and RTX 3080 systems
- Automatic performance optimization beyond mode-based scaling
- Real-time mode switching during execution
- Distributed computing across multiple environments
- Cloud deployment or containerization strategies

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Explicit Mode System** - CLI-based mode selection with development and production options
2. **Hardware Capability Detection** - Comprehensive hardware assessment and reporting system
3. **Unified CLI Interface** - Command-line interface with explicit mode selection and capability reporting
4. **Comprehensive Testing Suite** - Testing framework that validates both modes across different hardware configurations
5. **fastai/PyTorch Migration** - Convert existing working notebook implementations to production-ready Python modules
