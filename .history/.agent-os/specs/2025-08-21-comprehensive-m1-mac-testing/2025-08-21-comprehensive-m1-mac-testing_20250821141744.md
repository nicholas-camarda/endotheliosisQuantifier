# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: M1 Mac Development and Small-Scale Testing Strategy
> Created: 2025-08-21
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a development-focused testing strategy for the endotheliosis quantifier package on M1 Mac, enabling efficient development and small-scale validation while preparing the codebase for future migration to NVIDIA RTX 3080 with CUDA support. Focus on development workflow, code quality, and component testing with small datasets.

## User Stories

### Development Workflow Validation

As a developer working on an M1 Mac, I want to validate that I can efficiently develop, test, and iterate on the endotheliosis quantifier package, so that I can maintain high code quality and rapid development cycles without hardware constraints.

**Detailed Workflow:**
- Validate development environment setup and tools
- Test code editing, linting, and quality checks
- Verify unit testing and small-scale component testing
- Confirm debugging and error handling capabilities
- Test code iteration and development workflow efficiency

### Small-Scale Component Testing

As a developer, I want to test individual components of the package with small datasets on M1 Mac, so that I can validate functionality and catch issues early without requiring large-scale computational resources.

**Detailed Workflow:**
- Test data loading with small sample datasets
- Validate ML model components with reduced data sizes
- Test CLI interface with minimal data
- Verify feature extraction with small image samples
- Confirm quantification pipeline with mock or small data

### Future Migration Preparation

As a developer planning to use RTX 3080 for production workloads, I want to ensure the codebase is structured to easily migrate between Metal and CUDA backends, so that I can develop on M1 Mac and deploy on PC with minimal code changes.

**Detailed Workflow:**
- Validate backend abstraction and configuration
- Test switching between Metal and CPU backends
- Ensure code structure supports future CUDA integration
- Document migration path and requirements
- Prepare configuration for future RTX 3080 deployment

## Spec Scope

1. **Development Environment Testing** - Validate all development tools and workflow on M1 Mac
2. **Small-Scale Component Testing** - Test individual modules with small datasets and mock data
3. **Code Quality Assurance** - Unit testing, linting, and code validation
4. **Integration Testing with Mock Data** - End-to-end testing with small or mock datasets
5. **Backend Abstraction Validation** - Ensure code can switch between Metal and CPU backends
6. **Migration Path Documentation** - Document requirements for future CUDA/RTX 3080 support

## Out of Scope

- Large-scale model training or full dataset processing
- Performance benchmarking against CUDA systems
- Production-scale inference testing
- Memory-intensive operations beyond M1 Mac capabilities
- Driver compatibility testing for future RTX 3080 deployment
- Cross-platform compatibility beyond M1 Mac development environment

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Validated Development Environment** - Confirmed development workflow on M1 Mac with all tools functional
2. **Small-Scale Test Suite** - Comprehensive tests that work with small datasets and mock data
3. **Code Quality Framework** - Linting, unit testing, and validation tools working on M1 Mac
4. **Migration Documentation** - Clear path and requirements for future RTX 3080 deployment
