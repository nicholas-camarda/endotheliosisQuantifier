> Created: 2025-08-21
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive testing strategy to validate the entire endotheliosis quantifier package functionality on M1 Mac, ensuring all components work correctly within Apple Silicon constraints while providing clear documentation of any limitations or performance considerations.

## User Stories

### Complete Package Validation

As a developer working on an M1 Mac, I want to verify that the entire endotheliosis quantifier package functions correctly on my system, so that I can confidently use and develop the package without encountering unexpected compatibility issues.

**Detailed Workflow:**
- Run comprehensive tests for all package components
- Validate ML model functionality with TensorFlow/Metal
- Test CLI interface and pipeline execution
- Verify data processing and feature extraction
- Confirm quantification pipeline works end-to-end
- Document any performance limitations or compatibility issues

### Performance Benchmarking

As a researcher using the package on M1 Mac, I want to understand the performance characteristics and limitations of the package on Apple Silicon, so that I can plan my research workflows accordingly and set realistic expectations.

**Detailed Workflow:**
- Benchmark model training and inference times
- Compare performance with expected CUDA benchmarks
- Test memory usage and constraints
- Validate that performance is acceptable for research use
- Document performance characteristics for different data sizes

### Error Handling and Recovery

As a user encountering issues on M1 Mac, I want the package to provide clear error messages and graceful failure modes, so that I can understand what went wrong and how to resolve issues.

**Detailed Workflow:**
- Test error handling for Metal-specific issues
- Validate graceful degradation when components fail
- Ensure clear error messages for compatibility issues
- Test recovery mechanisms for common failure scenarios
- Document troubleshooting procedures for M1 Mac users

## Spec Scope

1. **Environment Validation** - Comprehensive testing of all dependencies and system compatibility on M1 Mac
2. **Component Testing** - Individual testing of each package module (data loading, segmentation, feature extraction, quantification)
3. **Integration Testing** - End-to-end pipeline testing with realistic data and mock components where needed
4. **CLI Interface Testing** - Complete validation of command-line interface functionality and error handling
5. **Performance Testing** - Benchmarking and performance validation within M1 Mac constraints
6. **Error Handling Testing** - Validation of graceful failure modes and error recovery mechanisms

## Out of Scope

- Performance optimization for M1 Mac (focus on functionality over optimization)
- CUDA-specific features or optimizations
- Testing on other Apple Silicon variants (M2, M3) beyond M1
- Cross-platform compatibility testing beyond M1 Mac
- Production deployment testing or scaling tests

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Comprehensive Test Suite** - Complete test coverage for all package components on M1 Mac
2. **Performance Benchmarks** - Documented performance characteristics and limitations
3. **Compatibility Report** - Clear documentation of what works, what has limitations, and any workarounds needed
4. **Error Handling Validation** - Verified graceful failure modes and troubleshooting procedures
