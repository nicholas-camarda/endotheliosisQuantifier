> Spec: Dual-Environment Architecture with Instant Workflow Switching
> Created: 2025-08-21
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a sophisticated dual-environment architecture for the endotheliosis quantifier package that enables instant switching between production (RTX 3080/CUDA) and development (M1 Mac/Metal) workflows. Design the system to automatically detect hardware capabilities, select appropriate backends, scale data processing, and provide identical CLI interfaces for seamless environment transitions without code changes.

## User Stories

### Instant Environment Switching

As a developer, I want to instantly switch between production (RTX 3080) and development (M1 Mac) workflows using the same codebase and commands, so that I can develop efficiently on M1 Mac and seamlessly deploy to production on RTX 3080 without any code modifications.

**Detailed Workflow:**
- Automatic hardware detection and environment configuration
- Seamless backend switching between Metal and CUDA
- Identical CLI commands work in both environments
- Automatic data scaling based on environment capabilities
- No code changes required to switch between environments

### Unified Development Workflow

As a developer, I want a unified development experience across both environments, so that I can use the same commands, configurations, and workflows regardless of whether I'm working on M1 Mac or RTX 3080.

**Detailed Workflow:**
- Same CLI interface and commands in both environments
- Consistent configuration management across environments
- Unified error handling and logging
- Identical development and testing procedures
- Seamless code deployment between environments

### Production-Ready Development

As a developer, I want to develop and test on M1 Mac with confidence that the same code will work identically on RTX 3080, so that I can maintain high development velocity while ensuring production compatibility.

**Detailed Workflow:**
- Develop and test on M1 Mac with small datasets
- Validate functionality and code quality locally
- Deploy to RTX 3080 for full-scale processing
- Ensure identical behavior and results across environments
- Maintain production performance and reliability

## Spec Scope

1. **Dual Environment Architecture** - Design system for seamless switching between production and development environments
2. **Automatic Hardware Detection** - Detect M1 Mac vs RTX 3080 and configure environment accordingly
3. **Backend Abstraction Layer** - Automatic selection and switching between Metal and CUDA backends
4. **Configuration Management** - Separate production and development configs with environment-specific settings
5. **Data Scaling Logic** - Automatic data scaling based on environment capabilities and memory constraints
6. **Unified CLI Interface** - Identical command-line interface that works in both environments
7. **Environment-Specific Testing** - Comprehensive testing for both production and development workflows

## Out of Scope

- Cross-platform compatibility beyond M1 Mac and RTX 3080
- Automatic performance optimization for specific hardware
- Real-time environment switching during execution
- Distributed computing across multiple environments
- Cloud deployment or containerization strategies

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Dual Environment System** - Complete architecture for instant switching between production and development workflows
2. **Automatic Configuration** - Hardware detection and environment-specific configuration management
3. **Unified CLI Interface** - Identical command-line interface that works seamlessly in both environments
4. **Comprehensive Testing Suite** - Testing framework that validates both production and development workflows
