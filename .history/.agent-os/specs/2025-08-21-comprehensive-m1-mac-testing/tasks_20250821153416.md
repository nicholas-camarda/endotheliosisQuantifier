## Implementation Notes

### Technical Dependencies
- Task 1 must be completed before Task 2 (environment setup)
- Task 2 must be completed before Task 3 (module availability)
- Task 3 must be completed before Task 4 (architecture foundation)
- Task 4 can be developed in parallel with Task 5 (CLI and migration)

### Testing Strategy
- Each major task follows TDD approach with tests written first
- Verification steps ensure existing functionality is evaluated before implementation
- Hardware detection tests will use mocking for cross-platform validation
- Mode selection tests will validate both development and production paths
- Integration tests will verify end-to-end pipeline functionality

### Key Deliverables
- Dual-environment architecture with explicit mode selection
- Hardware capability detection and reporting system
- Unified CLI interface with mode transparency
- fastai/PyTorch segmentation pipeline
- Comprehensive testing suite for all components
